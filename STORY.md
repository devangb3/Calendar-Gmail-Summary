# Daily Digest - My Journey

## Inspiration
As a busy grad student juggling multiple courses, assignments, and deadlines, I found myself constantly overwhelmed by the flood of Canvas notifications in my email and scattered calendar events. I would often miss important assignment deadlines or lecture schedule changes simply because they got lost in my cluttered inbox. This personal struggle inspired me to create Daily Digest - a smart assistant that helps students like me stay on top of their academic communications and schedules.

## What it does
Daily Digest seamlessly integrates with Google Calendar and Gmail to provide:
- AI-powered summaries of class schedules and Canvas notifications
- Audio briefings perfect for catching up to the schedule of the day
- Smart organization of assignment deadlines and course announcements
- Priority-based sorting of academic emails and events
- Real-time updates for class schedule changes
- Secure handling of student data

## How we built it
As a solo developer, I built Daily Digest using technologies:
- Backend: Python Flask (which I learned in my web development class)
- Frontend: React.js (self-taught through online resources)
- Database: MongoDB for storing user preferences
- AI Integration: Google's Gemini AI for intelligent and fast summarization
- Authentication: OAuth2 for Google services
- API Integration: Google Calendar and Gmail APIs
- Security: SSL/TLS encryption for data protection

## Challenges we ran into
1. Time Management: Balancing project development with coursework and assignments
2. Learning Curve: Teaching myself new technologies while implementing them
3. OAuth2 Complexity: Understanding and implementing Google's authentication flow
4. AI Integration: Fine-tuning Gemini AI to understand academic context

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
- Successfully integrated complex APIs and AI technology
- Created something that solves a real problem
- Learned multiple new technologies while building a practical solution
- Implemented secure authentication and data handling

## What I learned
- Full-stack development from ground up
- Working with AI APIs and OAuth2 authentication
- Database design and management
- The importance of user-centered design
- Time management and project planning

## What's next for Daily Digest
1. Add more Google Calendar Integration Features
2. Mobile app development
